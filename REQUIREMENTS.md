# Backend Code Challenge

## Overview

You’ll write a simple weather application to show the current weather in a given location.
We recommend using the Open Weather Map JSON API http://openweathermap.org/API to get
real weather data.

### What should the application do?

- Display the weather information for any given city
- Cache the fetched weather data (optional)
- Manage the cases where the weather’s information for a given city can’t be found

### What should I do?

- Create a new Node.js project using JavaScript or TypeScript.
- Write your solution with best practices and widely accepted standards in mind, such as:
  - Tests (Unit tests, integration tests)
  - Follow the JavaScript or TypeScript code guidelines
  - Understandable structure
  - Code that makes use of Object-Oriented Design
  - When possible, approach the problem using a functional mindset

## Additional Requirements

- Create a README.md at the root of the project and provide a project overview. It would be
  great if you can point out what you could improve on the project.
- Push your code to a public repository on (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) or any other
  repository. If you don’t have one, please create it.

### Getting Started

- Set up a new Node.js project.
- Install necessary packages (e.g., axios for HTTP requests, jest for testing).
- Use the Open Weather Map API to fetch weather data.
- Implement caching logic (optional, e.g., using in-memory caching or a caching library).
- Handle errors gracefully, ensuring a user-friendly response when a city's weather
  information can't be found.

## Guidelines

- Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure your code works as expected.
- Code Quality: Follow JavaScript or TypeScript coding standards and best practices.
- Documentation: Ensure your code is well-documented, and your README.md provides
  clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
